# My first personal project.

Over the course of Christmas break. I want to show that I can both explain to myself that I do have an understanding of programming, but also can create a project without aid from classmates(note: I do fully understanding working on a team means I will sometimes have help on job. But independent work is still important and that is the main focus here.). Each day I will record what I accomplished in the app here and will list my plan for Project: T(patent pending).

## Daily goals.

I wish to work on CSS to some degree each day of working. This will involve both experimenting and searching. In terms of functionality, a page a day will be the standard wish. In terms of time, I will treat this project as a ticket for a job. This will be a 9-5 work with a one hour lunch break and a standard of 15 minute breaks throughout the day. Unless deadlines become close, I will do no before nore after work. This will be to help me prepare mentally for scheduling around a typical work time flow.

### Goals of the project.

Being a Twitter user for years, I have my fair share of gripes with the app. Using the Twitter API. My goal will be to create a version of the blue bird. My own version that impliments ideas and features taken both from my own mind, as well as friends of mine.
